# Web-Based Price Comparison System Using Web Scraping

## ABSTRACT

The **Web-Based Price Comparison System Using Web Scraping** is designed to simplify online shopping by enabling users to compare product prices from multiple e-commerce platforms within a single interface. In today’s digital marketplace, customers often need to visit several websites such as **Amazon, Flipkart, and eBay** to check product prices, discounts, ratings, and availability. This manual comparison process is **time-consuming**, **inefficient**, and may lead to **uninformed purchasing decisions** due to fluctuating prices and the lack of consolidated information.

The proposed system addresses this issue by implementing **web scraping techniques** to automatically extract **real-time product data** from multiple e-commerce websites. The collected information includes:

- Product Name  
- Price  
- Discount Details  
- Ratings  
- Availability Status  

This data is processed and organized in a **structured format**. A **comparison engine** analyzes the information to identify the **lowest price** and **best available offers**. The results are displayed through a **user-friendly web interface**, allowing customers to quickly view and compare product details without navigating multiple websites.

By automating the price comparison process, the system:

- Reduces user effort  
- Saves time  
- Improves decision-making efficiency  
- Enhances transparency in online shopping  

This project demonstrates the practical application of:

- Web Scraping  
- Backend Processing  
- Web Development Technologies  

to create an **efficient and reliable solution** for modern consumers.

The system can be further extended with advanced features such as:

- Price trend analysis  
- Intelligent recommendations  
- Automated price drop alerts  

to further improve functionality and user experience.
