# Web-Based Price Comparison System Using Web Scraping

## ABSTRACT

The Web-Based Price Comparison System Using Web Scraping is designed to simplify online shopping by enabling users to compare product prices from multiple e-commerce platforms within a single interface. In today’s digital marketplace, customers often need to visit several websites such as Amazon, Flipkart, and eBay to check product prices, discounts, ratings, and availability. This manual comparison process is time-consuming, inefficient, and may lead to uninformed purchasing decisions due to fluctuating prices and lack of consolidated information.
The proposed system addresses this issue by implementing web scraping techniques to automatically extract real-time product data from multiple e-commerce websites. The collected information, including product name, price, discount details, ratings, and availability status, is processed and organized in a structured format. A comparison engine then analyzes the data to identify the lowest price and best available offers. The results are presented through a user-friendly web interface that allows customers to quickly view and compare product details without navigating multiple websites.
By automating the price comparison process, the system reduces user effort, saves time, and improves decision-making efficiency. It also enhances transparency in online shopping by providing accurate and up-to-date information in one place. This project demonstrates the practical application of web scraping, backend processing, and web development technologies to create an efficient and reliable solution for modern consumers. The system can be further extended with advanced features such as price trend analysis and intelligent recommendations to improve functionality and user experience.
